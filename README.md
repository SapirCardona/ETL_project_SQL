README: ETL & Data Warehouse Implementation

This project is a solution to an ETL and Data Warehouse design exercise. The goal was to design, implement, and optimize a data warehouse for a business to support data-driven decision-making.

Task Overview:
Business Case Definition – We selected a fashion boutique owned by an independent designer and identified the key data entities the business needs to store and analyze.

Schema Selection:
We chose a Star Schema due to its simplicity, fast query performance, and suitability for business intelligence (BI) reporting.

Database Implementation – We created the required SQL scripts to define a Fact Table for purchases and Dimension Tables for products, employees, orders, payments, and customers.

Included Files:
SQL scripts for creating Fact and Dimension tables
Sample records for populating tables

This data warehouse structure enables efficient querying, simplifies reporting, and supports business insights for the boutique.
